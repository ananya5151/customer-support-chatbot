# Intelligent E-Commerce Chatbot

This project is a fully functional customer support chatbot designed to provide intelligent, automated assistance for a fictional e-commerce platform. It leverages a sophisticated AI agent framework (CrewAI) to understand user queries and interact with various tools to provide accurate information.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Multi-Tool Agent:** The chatbot can dynamically choose between different tools to answer questions:
    * **Product Search:** Looks up product information (price, stock) from a CSV database.
    * **FAQ Search:** Retrieves answers to common questions about store policies (shipping, returns).
    * **Order Status:** Connects to a mock API to check the real-time status of orders.
* **Robust Error Handling:** Features advanced prompt engineering to gracefully handle ambiguous ("I need help") and off-topic ("tell me a joke") queries without crashing or looping.
* **Conversational Memory:** Remembers the context of the conversation to provide more natural and coherent interactions.
* **Web Interface:** A clean, user-friendly chat interface built with Streamlit.
* **Decoupled Architecture:** Built with a separate frontend (Streamlit) and backend (Flask), a standard practice for scalable web applications.

## üìÇ Architecture

The application runs as two separate processes that communicate with each other:
1.  **Backend API (`backend_api.py`):** A Flask server that initializes the CrewAI agent and exposes a `/chat` endpoint. This is the "brain" of the operation.
2.  **Frontend UI (`app.py`):** A Streamlit application that provides the user interface. It sends user queries to the Flask backend and displays the response.
